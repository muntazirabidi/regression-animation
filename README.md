# Linear Regression Visualizer

This interactive web application demonstrates the concepts of linear regression through visualization. It allows users to manipulate parameters and see real-time changes in the regression line, making it an excellent tool for students learning about statistical modeling.

## Features

- Interactive scatter plot with adjustable data points
- Real-time updates of regression line
- Sliders for adjusting slope and intercept
- Visualization of residuals
- R² (R-squared) calculation and visualization
- Data regeneration with adjustable noise levels
- Animated transition to best-fit line

## How to Use

1. Visit the deployed app: [Linear Regression Visualizer](https://muntazirabidi.github.io/regression-animation)
2. Use the sliders to adjust the slope and intercept of the regression line
3. Click "Regenerate Data" to create a new dataset
4. Toggle "Show Residuals" to visualize the error between the line and data points
5. Click "Start Animation" to see the line adjust to the best fit
6. Explore the R² visualization to understand model fit
